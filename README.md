# MysteriousOrganism
My solution for the Codecademy Mysterious Organism challenge.

The challenge involved mutating an unknown organism's DNA code.

The second step was to compare two organism's DNA and return the commonality between the two individuals.

Thirdly, the program determines whether the individual is likely to survive based on a condition of the array of the DNA code containing at least 60% 'C' or 'G' types.

Finally, the code creates thirty random individual DNA bases and test the program.
